# Verification log

Every batch appends to this file. A lesson is only "done" when it has a green row here.

Legend:
- **install** — `pnpm install` at workspace root completes without errors
- **check** — `pnpm --filter <pkg> check` reports 0 errors and 0 warnings
- **build** — `pnpm --filter <pkg> build` succeeds
- **autofixer** — every `.svelte` file in the package was passed through the Svelte MCP `svelte-autofixer` tool at its latest revision and reported no unfixed issues (other than documented false positives)
